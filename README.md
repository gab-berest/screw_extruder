# Screw Extruder

Screw extruder is a program to control the speed and temperature of the screw extruder.

## Installation

Use the arduino software [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to install the program directly via USB to the microcontroller.

## Usage

Use the encoder to select one of the two top menus: RPM or Temperature.

RPM selects the mototr speed in rotation per minute.
Temperature sets the contorl temperature of the nozzle heater band and automaticcaly sets the preheat to half.

Two bottom menus only show the current speed of the motor and the current temperature of each heat band.

Data folders are the data used to tune the default PID values.
