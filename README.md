# Screw Extruder

Screw extruder is a program to control the speed and temperature of the screw extruder.

## Installation

Use the arduino software [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to install the program directly via USB to the microcontroller.

## Usage

Use the encoder to select one of the four top menus: RPM, Nozzle Temperature, Preheat temperature and fan speed.

RPM selects the motor speed in rotation per minute.
Temperature nozzle sets the control temperature of the nozzle heater band.
Temperature preheat sets the control temperature of the preheat heater band.
Fan speed sets the fan speed.

Three bottom menus only show the current speed of the motor, the nozzle temperature and the preheat temperature.

Data folders are the data used to tune the default PID values.
